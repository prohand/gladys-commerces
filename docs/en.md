# Horaires Commerces — user guide

This integration brings into Gladys the **opening hours** of the shops you go to:
which shops are open, when they open or close, with scenes when a shop opens or
closes soon.

Everything is computed in Gladys. The only call out is to OpenStreetMap, through the
overpass.ch service and with your free key, to find the hours of shops around your
houses (see **overpass.ch key** below). Without a key, type the hours of your shops
yourself.

## Set up

Open **Integrations**, find the integration, install it, then fill in the
**Configuration** screen.

| Field                   | What to put                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| overpass.ch key         | Your free key, to look up the hours on OpenStreetMap (see below).              |
| Shops and opening hours | Your shops and their hours (see below).                                        |
| Houses to search around | The Gladys houses to search around. None checked: every house with a location. |
| Search radius ... (km)  | How far from a house the shops are looked for. Default: 10.                    |
| Kinds of shops ...      | The kinds of shops offered in the Discovery tab. None checked: none.           |
| Notice before ... (min) | When the "opens soon" / "closes soon" triggers fire. Default: 30 minutes.      |

Then click **Test the configuration**: the answer says, shop by shop, whether it is
open.

Finally, open the **Discovery** tab of the integration and create the devices.

### Shops and opening hours

One shop per entry: a name, then `=` and its hours if you want to type them. Separate the shops with `|`:

```
Leclerc = Mo-Sa 08:30-20:00; PH off | Pharmacy = Mo-Fr 09:00-19:00 | Bakery = Tu-Su 07:00-13:00,15:30-19:30
```

The hours use the OpenStreetMap syntax — often already shown on the shop's map page:

| You write                           | It means                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `Mo-Sa 08:30-20:00`                 | Monday to Saturday, 8:30 to 20:00              |
| `Mo-Fr 08:30-12:00,14:00-19:00`     | With a lunch break                             |
| `Mo-Sa 08:30-20:00; Su 09:00-12:30` | Rules separated by `;`                         |
| `Mo-Sa 08:30-20:00; We 08:30-21:00` | A later rule replaces the earlier one that day |
| `...; PH off`                       | Closed on French public holidays               |
| `...; PH 09:00-12:30`               | Shorter hours on public holidays               |
| `24/7`                              | Always open                                    |

Days: `Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su`. `PH` = French public holidays (Easter Monday,
Ascension and Whit Monday included). Hours are read on the French clock. Up to 10
shops.

The name identifies the shop: renaming it creates a new device in Gladys.

#### Hours found automatically

Write only the name: `Leclerc` (or `Leclerc = auto`). The integration then looks on
OpenStreetMap for the shop of that name nearest to your Gladys houses (all the
houses with a location, set in **Settings → Houses**), and takes its hours. To look
for other words than the name, write them after `auto:`, for example
`Bakery = auto: Boulangerie Dupont`. Accents and case do not matter. This needs a free overpass.ch key (see
**overpass.ch key** below).

- With several houses, the nearest shop of all houses wins: give a precise name
  (`auto: Carrefour Market Vierzon`) to pick one near a given house.
- **Test the configuration** names the shop found, its town, its distance and its
  hours: check it is the right one.
- The hours are looked up again once a day, and kept: a restart without network
  keeps them.
- If OpenStreetMap has no hours for your shop, or hours the integration cannot
  read, type them by hand (and why not add them on openstreetmap.org).

### Shops around your houses (Discovery tab)

The integration looks on OpenStreetMap, around each Gladys house with a location
(set in **Settings → Houses**), for the nearest shops of the kinds checked in the
configuration — supermarkets, bakeries, pharmacies, post offices, recycling
centres… — that publish their opening hours. The 3 nearest of each kind, per house.

Open the **Discovery** tab of the integration: each shop is listed with its house
and its distance, for example `E.Leclerc (Home, 1.3 km)`. Create the ones you go to,
in a room of the right house, and rename them as you like: they work like the shops
you type, and their hours are kept up to date once a day.

### overpass.ch key

The hours are looked up on OpenStreetMap through the [overpass.ch](https://overpass.ch)
service, with your own free key: without a key, nothing is looked up (the shops
typed with their hours work all the same). The free plan (no credit card, for
personal use) gives 10,000 requests a month; the integration makes one a day.

1. Open [overpass.ch/signup](https://overpass.ch/signup) (**Get a free key** button on
   the home page).
2. Fill in **E-mail**, **Password** (at least 10 characters) and **Website** (for
   example `https://github.com/prohand/gladys-horaires-commerces`), tick the terms,
   then click **Create account** (or **Continue with Google**).
3. Open the e-mail you receive and click the confirmation link.
4. **Log in** and open the keys page:
   [overpass.ch/dashboard/keys](https://overpass.ch/dashboard/keys). Create a key.
   **Leave "Allowed referers" empty and do not tick "Reject requests without a
   referer"**: the integration sends no referer, the server would refuse its requests
   (error 403 `forbidden_referer`).
5. Copy the key. Its whole URL, `https://api.overpass.ch/v1/…/interpreter`, works too.
6. In Gladys: **Integrations** → **Horaires Commerces** → **Configuration**, paste it
   in **overpass.ch key** and save.
7. Click **Test the configuration**. The integration logs say
   `OpenStreetMap answered by api.overpass.ch` when the key works.

The key is personal: do not publish it (forum, code repository, screenshot). A key
refused or a monthly quota used up is told by **Test the configuration** and in the
logs (`OpenStreetMap lookup failed: overpass.ch refused the key (403)`); the hours
found before stay, and the lookup tries again within the hour.

## Devices

| Device    | Feature                          | Notes                         |
| --------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Each shop | Open (1 = open, 0 = closed)      | Usable in any scene condition |
| Each shop | Minutes until it opens or closes | Updated every minute          |

## Scenes

### Triggers

- **A shop opens soon** (`store_opening_soon`) and **A shop closes soon**
  (`store_closing_soon`): fired once, the configured number of minutes before. Filter:
  the shop (empty = any). Variables: shop name, time, minutes left. Example: "The
  {{store_name}} closes at {{time}}, {{minutes_left}} minutes left."

"The shop is open" is a state: use the device conditions of Gladys.

### Actions

- **Is a shop open?** (`is_store_open`): choose a shop. Outputs: _open_ (yes/no), the
  time of the next change (HH:MM) and the minutes until then.

## Dashboard

- **Shop hours**: every shop at a glance (open or closed, until when), or — with the
  setting _Shop_ — one shop in detail, with a countdown and today's hours.

## Troubleshooting

- **The Discovery tab is empty**: click **Test the configuration**: it looks again
  on OpenStreetMap and says why (house without a location, no kind checked,
  OpenStreetMap unreachable, no shop of these kinds within the radius).
- **"overpass.ch key missing"**: paste your key in the configuration (see
  **overpass.ch key** above).
- **"OpenStreetMap could not be reached"**: the message says why (key refused, quota
  used up, server unreachable). Check the key on
  [overpass.ch/dashboard/keys](https://overpass.ch/dashboard/keys); new try within the
  hour.
- **"No shop of this name ... on OpenStreetMap"**: try fewer words, a wider
  **Search radius**, or type the hours by hand.
- **"No house of Gladys has a location"**: set the house location in **Settings →
  Houses**.
- **"The opening hours are not understood"**: the message names the wrong part. Use
  the English day names (`Mo`, not `Lu`) and `HH:MM` times (`08:30`, not `8h30`).
- **A shop is "not understood"**: each entry must be `Name = hours`, entries separated
  by `|`.

## Data

To find the hours (shops written without hours, and the Discovery tab), the words
looked for, the kinds of shops and the location of your houses (an area of the
search radius around each) are sent to the OpenStreetMap Overpass API
of overpass.ch (`api.overpass.ch`, in Germany), with your key, once a day. The hours found are kept in `/data/hours.json`. To
send nothing: set no key, and type the hours of every shop.
